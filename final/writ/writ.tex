\section{Introduction}
We first introduce the problem at hand and overview our solution and its
success.

\subsection{The Movie-Chain-Runner Problem}
The Movie-Chain-Runner Problem is to find the longest chain of overlapping
titles in a list of movie titles, where two titles are said to overlap if some
suffix of the first movie is identical to some prefix of the second movie. For
example, in the list
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Day of the Dead
\item Live and Let Die
\item Dead Poets' Society
\item Die Another Day
\item The Last Samurai
\end{itemize}
the longest chain consists of 4 titles:

\begin{center}
Live and Let Die Another Day of the Dead Poets' Society
\end{center}
By appropriately representing the movie list as a graph, the Movie-Chain-Runner
Problem can be shown to be equivalent to the Longest Path Problem (finding the
longest simple path in a directed graph). The Longest Path Problem is well
known to be NP-Complete, meaning that no efficient algorithm exists to find
longest paths in large graphs, including our movie title graph. A review of the
literature reveals that good approximate longest paths also cannot be found
efficiently in large graphs. Thus, our project is to study the movie title
graph and innovate ways to find long paths in the graph.

\subsection{Our Approach}

\subsection{Success}

\section{Approach}

\subsection{Algorithms}
\underline{Ideas that worked:}

We tried an algorithm that computes acyclic subgraphs of our graph and then
runs a polynomial time Longest Path algorithm known for acyclic graphs.
However, the number of cycles proved too large to generate the subgraphs in a
reasonable amount of time, and so we abandoned this effort.

We also considered some more elaborate algorithms we found in the literature:
a color-coding algorithm proposed by Alon et al.\hspace{-0.2cm}
\footnote{Noga Alon , Raphael Yuster , Uri Zwick, Color-coding, Journal of the
ACM (JACM), v.42 n.4, p.844-856, July 1995. (accessed June 16, 2013 at
\texttt{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=210337}).}
and the genetic algorithms studied by Portugal et al.\hspace{-0.2cm}
\footnote{
D. Portugal, C. H. Antunes, R. Rocha, ``A Study of Genetic Algorithms for
Approximating the Longest Path in Generic Graphs,'' Proc. of the IEEE SMC, pp.
2539-2544, 2010. (accessed June 16, 2013 at
\texttt{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5641920\&
navigation=1}).}
However, due to the complexity of implementing these algorithms and the success
of our simpler algorithms, we opted not to try them.

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}
Our group consistently met about twice a week to plan and distribute our tasks
After evaluating our team's work on the project, we will reflect on lessons
learned and recommendations for future groups.
\subsection{Evaluation}
We used three methods to evaluate the success of our project.\\\\
\underline{Method 1: Chain Length}

Our project was a success in that the number of titles in our longest
chain exceeded 300. Although we failed to establish a new record, this
secondary goal was optional and not expected.\\\\
\underline{Method 2: Algorithm Comparison}

Our second method of evaluation was to compare different algorithms to
decide on a ``best'' algorithm for the problem. Although we did not test a
diverse selection of algorithms, we did attempt several variants on the basic
brute force algorithm and document the longest chain each variant found. Table
1 presents the results.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|c}
Algorithm                               & Longest Chain \\
\hline
Brute-Force                             &               \\
Brute-Force w/ reversal                 &               \\
Brute-Force w/ reversal and insertion   &               \\
DAG Poly-time                           &               \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Longest chain found by each algorithm}

\end{table}
\\\\
\underline{Method 3: Time Prediction}

In order to guage the difficulty of the problem at hand, we also attempted to
predict the time needed to solve the problem by exploring all possible paths
in the movie graph. To do this, we first measured the time taken to solve the
problem on many random subgraphs of the movie graph and used this data to fit
an exponential relation between the size of the graph and the time taken for
the computation. We then extrapolated this relation to conclude that performing
the computation on the entire graph would take about 1.03 trillion years,
approximately 100 times the lifespan of the sun. Appendix B gives a detailed
discussion of the experiment and its results and validity.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
We learned several things about programming for large computational problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using primarily brute-force algorithms, we came quite close to (likely
within 13\% of) the optimal solution. Thus, although far from optimal in
theory, brute-force algorithms can produce decent solutions for some NP-hard
problems in practice.
\item For algorithms with large asymptotic runtimes, constant factors are
important - a 50\% runtime reduction is very significant when the algorithm can
take a week or more to run. This fact is really understated in CS classes.
\item With a high level language (like Python) it is crucial to consider all
available data structures and their implementations. We noticed too late that
using a set rather than a list for part of our code might have sped up our
program by a factor of 100.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recomendations}
Our team's work ethic and organization were crucial to our success. We
recommend having frequent meeting (at least twice weekly) in order to
coordinate work and

\section{Progress}
We discuss our progress in three sections: General Progress, Status, and
Projections.

\subsection{Status}
Our current longest chain (included in Appendix A) consists of 278 titles,
7 titles short of our June 17 goal of 285 titles. Since extending the movie
chain has proven more difficult than we anticipated, we have decided to scale
back our final goal from 300 titles to 285 titles. Since 285 titles is the
necessary criterion for receiving an A on the project, the benefits of 300
titles are primarily cosmetic, and so we consider this change acceptable.

Figure \ref{fig:gantto} below shows the original Gantt chart presented in
our project proposal. Figure \ref{fig:ganttn} below shows our revised Gantt
chart, as of June 17. The only changes are that the 300 title goal originally
set for June 25 has been eliminated and the 285 title goal originally set for
June 17 has been extended to June 25.
