{\bf Abstract}\\
\end{center}
We attempted to solve the Movie-Chain-Runner Problem, a computational problem
equivalent to the well-known Longest Path Problem. We designed and used Python
to implement several algorithms for the problem, and include our best solution.
In the end, we accomplished our original goal of constructing a movie chain of
at least 300 titles. We also performed some analyses of both the problem and
our algorithms, and use them here to discuss approaches to the problem.
Finally, we overview and reflect on our group's approach and success.
