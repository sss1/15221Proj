via Windows/Mac Python install
Install Python
from: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/
Note: probably already installed on Macs!
Note: be sure to use appropriate 32-bit or 64-bit install!
Add the python directory to your system path (also probably not required on Macs, here are some instructions for Windows):
First, you have to find where Python installed itself.  You might try to look for it in one of these locations:
c:\program files\python27
c:\program files (x86)\python27
c:\python27
Once you found it, you have to tell the Command Shell where to find it (silly, but true), as such:
Go to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Environment Variables
On bottom half of window (System Variables), select Path and click Edit button
In the variable value textbox, go to the end and type a semicolon, then...
Type the path to the directory where you found the Python install (back in step 1 above)
Click ok as needed (three times, probably) to finish the procedure.
Changes will be visible the next time you open a Command Prompt (or shell or terminal)
Run a Command Prompt or Command Shell or Terminal
Type   python   or type    python myscript.py
(If it says that python is not recognized or found, it means you did not set your path correctly above.  Please see a course staff member for assistance!)
To run IDLE (Python GUI):  either run IDLE from Start menu, or type:  python -m idlelib.idle
