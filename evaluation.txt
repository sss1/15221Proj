1. Length of longest chain

2. We can run different algorithms and compare them by
    (a) how long they take to find chains of a given length
    (b) the length of the longest chain they find in a fixed amount of time
This would allow us to report a `best' algorithm out of those we try

3. We can attempt to predict the time needed to solve to problem completely by
running our algorithms on tractable subproblems of varying sizes and
extrapolating the running times.
