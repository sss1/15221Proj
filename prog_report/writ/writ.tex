\section{Overview}
This report documents our progress on the Movie-Chain-Runner Problem
(discussed in section 2) as of June 17, 2013, as well as our plans for how to
proceed until the project deadline of June 27, 2013. We also discuss and
justify some changes to the plan presented in our project proposal
(submitted June 4, 2013).

\section{The Movie-Chain-Runner Problem}
The Movie-Chain-Runner Problem is to find the longest chain of overlapping
titles in a list of movie titles, where two titles are said to overlap if some
suffix of the first movie is identical to some prefix of the second movie. For
example, in the list
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Day of the Dead
\item Live and Let Die
\item Dead Poets' Society
\item Die Another Day
\item The Last Samurai
\end{itemize}
the longest chain consists of 4 titles:

\begin{center}
Live and Let Die Another Day of the Dead Poets' Society
\end{center}
By appropriately representing the movie list as a graph, the Movie-Chain-Runner
Problem can be shown to be equivalent to the Longest Path Problem (finding the
longest simple path in a directed graph). The Longest Path Problem is well
known to be NP-Complete, meaning that no efficient algorithm exists to find
longest paths in large graphs, including our movie title graph. A review of the
literature also reveals that good approximate longest paths also cannot be
found efficiently in large graphs. Thus, our project is to study the movie
title graph and innovate ways to find long paths in the graph.

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\section{Progress}
We discuss our progress in three sections: General Progress, Status, and
Projections.

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\subsection{General Progress}
Our first step was to reconstruct the list of movie titles as a directed graph,
reducing the problem to the well-known Longest Path Problem.
We proceeded to implement a greedy brute force algorithm that simply followed
as many paths as possible. This quickly constructed a path of 243 titles and
then ceased to make appreciable progress.

The majority of our efforts have since been towards augmenting this brute force
algorithm. We have run the algorithm ``backwards'' to extend the beginning of
the chain. We have also attempted running the algorithm in parallel over
several cluster computers, boosting our processing power and thus increasing
the number of possible paths we can check. We are currently running the brute
force algorithm on subsections of the current longest chain, in an attempt to
lengthen the middle of the chain.

We also attempted a theoretically-inspired algorithm which computed acyclic
subgraphs of our graph and then ran a polynomial time Longest Path algorithm
known for directed acyclic graphs. However, the number of cycles proved too
large to generate the subgraphs in a reasonable amount of time, and so we
abandoned this effort.

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\subsection{Status}
Our current longest chain (included in Appendix A) consists of 278 titles,
7 titles short of our June 17 goal of 285 titles. Since extending the movie chain has
proven more difficult than we anticipated, we have decided to scale back our
final goal from 300 titles to 285 titles. Since 285 titles is the necessary
criterion for receiving an A on the project, the benefits of 300 titles are
primarily cosmetic, and so we consider this change acceptable.

Figure \ref{fig:gantto} below shows the original Gantt chart presented in
our project proposal. Figure \ref{fig:ganttn} below shows our revised Gantt
chart, as of June 17. The only changes are that the 300 title goal originally
set for June 25 has been eliminated and the 285 title goal originally set for
June 17 has been extended to June 25.

\newpage
\subsection{Projections}
We expect that we will accomplish our revised 285 title goal for June 25 and
propose 2 simple approaches to this goal.
Firstly, although we have devoted much computational power toward extending the
longest chain at either end, we have not considered a potentially large number
of alternative paths between nodes in the chain. Thus, we will attempt to
compute, for adjacent or nearby nodes, alternative (longer) chains connecting
the same nodes. Secondly, we are considering ways to ``trim'' the graph by
removing nodes unlikely to be in the longest chain, thus reducing the number of
possible paths that must be considered.

If simple methods prove insufficient, we may also implement a color-coding
algorithm proposed by Alon et al.\hspace{-0.2cm}
\footnote{Noga Alon , Raphael Yuster , Uri Zwick, Color-coding, Journal of the
ACM (JACM), v.42 n.4, p.844-856, July 1995. (accessed June 16, 2013 at
\texttt{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=210337}).}
or the genetic algorithms studied by Portugal et al.,\hspace{-0.2cm}
\footnote{
D. Portugal, C. H. Antunes, R. Rocha, ``A Study of Genetic Algorithms for
Approximating the Longest Path in Generic Graphs,'' Proc. of the IEEE SMC, pp.
2539-2544, 2010. (accessed June 16, 2013 at
\texttt{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5641920\&
navigation=1}).}
although, due to the implementation complexity of these algorithms, we hope
this will be unnecessary.

\section{Recomendations}
Our only recomendation is the change of the final project goal from 300 titles
to 285 titles, as discussed in the Progress section above.

\section{Discussion}
Our final deliverable will now be a chain of at least 285 movie titles rather
than a chain of at least 300 movie titles. If, however, we achieve our 285
title goal before our deadline of June 25, we may spend the remaining time
attempting to extend the chain further.
