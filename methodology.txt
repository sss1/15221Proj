Abstract Model: Direct Graph, obtained by processing the input file
                then get a 2-D list as adjacency list.
Programming Languages: Python, Bash Script Language (for split process).

Several Methods:
1. Brute Force.
    Tried on 16 GHC machines, each ran 15 hours.
    Resulting longest: 247.
    Process became exponentially slower. Halt.

2. Knowing that if we have Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
   we can get the longest path in polynomial time, we tried to
   remove edges from the given graph structure to make DAGs.
   However, the processing time to generate and analysis each DAG
   was 1s. Too long. Halt.

3. (Current method) Given the movie chanes of length 240+, we revert
   the direction of all edges and see whether we can trace back
   further to generate longer paths. To be done tonight.
