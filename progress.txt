Started 11 process in 11 GHC machines for Algorithm 3.
As of now, the longest chain has 274 elements.
Because GHC machines will all restart in 6 hours, this run
will be short, so I don't think there will be signicant
increase in the length.

Checked the result. Longest is 277 (two of them got that
far). The rest include some 274, 270, etc. Maybe I will
run more processes tonight (maybe 10 processes per machine
on 15 machines), but I need to figure out a way to automate
this process (I cannot type in the command for each manually).
